    "# Created a pseudo-code algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pseudo code an algorithm that will count the maximum number of candies you can buy, depending on the money you have and the price of the candy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  For starters, you should calculate the real money which represents the amount of cash you have available, and the real price which represents the unit price of the candy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The expected result is an integer representing the maximum number of candies, or the largest number of candies that money allows you to buy!\n",
    "\n",
    "4. For example, if your money is equal to 12.47 and the price is equal to 1.14, the expected result will be 10 (because you can't buy 10.938596491 candies!).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use a loop to calculate this result. You're not allowed to use a rounding method.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Write the pseudo code in a Gist and share the bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validation criteria**\n",
    "\n",
    "• The pseudo code verifies that your money and the price are always higher than 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "• A loop is used to calculate the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "• The number of candies returned is always an integer (no possibility of a decimal)."
